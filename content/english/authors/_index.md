Our multidisciplinary team brings together researchers specializing in assisted human reproduction, control engineering, robotics, intelligent systems, and computer vision. This diversity of knowledge has allowed us to create an innovative solution in the field of in vitro fertilization (IVF).

We founded this company with the conviction that we will create truly disruptive technologies, challenging major international players who currently dominate the market. We believe in the potential of Brazilian technology to stand out on the world stage, using science, technology, and a lot of innovation.

Our greatest advantage is our people! We trust the process to develop a disruptive solution, aware of the challenges we will face but confident that we will become giants. We invite you to follow this Recife-based startup as we make history. We are committed to providing the highest standard of care and innovation to help families fulfill the dream of having a child.
