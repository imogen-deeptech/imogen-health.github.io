  introduction:
    text: Classifying embryos in the laboratory is a challenging process that takes days and relies on the expertise of the professional. Our solution combines artificial intelligence (AI) with a decision support system, while our equipment keeps the embryos safe and continuously captures photos. The AI evaluates them with the prosperity index, a quality score to assist in the laboratory's daily work. We offer automated and integrated management, with a vast database. Our business model operates on a pay-per-use basis and focuses on after-sales service.
